# Testscripts

This directory contains all the test scrips, written in Python.<br>

## A few details
- `test_diode.py` is the main script for starting the tests.
- `test_diode.py` is controlled by the settings in `dd_config.py`.
- `test_diode.py` needs sudo privileges to run properly.
- All `dd_ ... .py` scripts contain modularized code.

## Remarks
- These scripts are not build with object orientation in mind; however code modularization has been applied.
- The scripts need refactoring.
